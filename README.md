Our work is divided into two Notebooks, the first notebook is developed for making data preprocessing and the second for building the Model of machine learning.
1st Notebook: In this part, we did a preprocessing data by cleaning data and extract our important information, for the df file we extracted the RNA sequence and the matched sequence by using the Split function and put them in two different columns called (Rna_id, Sequence), and we developed a function which predicts the Anti sequence for each sequence and makes it in a different column called (Anti_Seuqence).
For the other file which contains all other information (Disease Name, Dysfunction(Up-Down)â€¦.),  we delete all Nan Values in the two columns (Disease Name and Rna_id), because we will fit our model by these important columns, and we fill Nan values for Dysfunction columns, and we drop all useless columns. After doing this function we joined our two files in one file called Pre_data based on Rna_id.
2nd Notebook where we build our model, we create a dictionary for Rna_id and Disease name and we affected for each Rna_id a number, and we embedded these two vectors and concatenate them to and them as inputs for our model. The model as is illustrated in the figure, we have 3 layers (32, 16, 8 ) neurons with uniform initialization and Relu activation, we will have 8 outputs after the third layer which will be concatenated again with the product of the two inputs so that model can learn more. The second figure shows all parameters that we have from the input until the outputs. We saved our output in a Model.h5 which give us the most matched Rna_id for each disease name and the probability that this RNA matched to this disease (Proba>0.5) and for every sequence each Anti sequence
